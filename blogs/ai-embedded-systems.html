    <h1>AI in Embedded Systems: Where Software Meets Hardware</h1>
    <p class="muted">Published by Prakhar Pandey</p>

    <p>
      Embedded systems have traditionally been designed to perform fixed,
      well-defined tasks. With the integration of artificial intelligence,
      these systems are becoming more adaptive, efficient, and capable of
      decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI in embedded systems enables devices to process data locally instead of
      relying entirely on cloud servers. This approach, often referred to as
      edge AI, reduces latency, improves reliability, and enhances privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applications of AI-powered embedded systems include smart sensors,
      autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and industrial automation.
      These systems combine constrained hardware with optimized machine
      learning models.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main challenge lies in balancing computational requirements with
      limited memory, power, and processing capabilities. This has led to
      innovations in lightweight models and hardware-aware optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
      As AI continues to evolve, embedded systems will play a crucial role in
      bringing intelligence closer to the physical world.
